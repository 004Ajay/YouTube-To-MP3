How to make it yours:

* Download the zip of this repo
* Go to YouTube-To-MP3-main > YouTubeToMP3 > dist > YouTubeToMP3 > `YouTubeToMP3.exe`

* If your computer shows any warning, select `Run anyway` (it's because your system recognize the .exe file as a foreign object)

* Make a shortcut of `YouTubeToMP3.exe` to Desktop (if you need it frequently)
